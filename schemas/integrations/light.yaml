title: Light
description: A light entity.
type: object
additionalProperties: false
required:
  - entity_id
properties:
  entity_id:
    description: String or list of strings that point at entity_ids of lights. To target all lights, set entity_id to all.
    type: string
  transition:
    description: Number that represents the time (in seconds) the light should take to transition to the new state.
    type: integer
  profile:
    description: String with the name of one of the built-in profiles (relax, energize, concentrate, reading) or one of the custom profiles defined in light_profiles.csv in the current working directory. Light profiles define an xy color, brightness and a transition value (if no transition is desired, set to 0 or leave out the column entirely). If a profile is given, and a brightness is set, then the profile brightness will be overwritten.
    type: string
  hs_color:

  rgbw_color:
    description: A list containing four integers between 0 and 255 representing the RGBW color you want the light to be. Four comma-separated integers that represent the color in RGBW (red, green, blue, white), within square brackets. This attribute will be ignored by lights which do not support RGBW colors.

  rgbww_color:
    description: A list containing five integers between 0 and 255 representing the RGBWW color you want the light to be. Five comma-separated integers that represent the color in RGBWW (red, green, blue, cold white, warm white), within square brackets. This attribute will be ignored by lights which do not support RGBWW colors.

    type: string
  brightness:
    description: Integer between 0 and 255 for how bright the light should be, where 0 means the light is off, 1 is the minimum brightness and 255 is the maximum brightness supported by the light.
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 255
  brightness_pct:
    description: Alternatively, you can specify brightness in percent (a number between 0 and 100), where 0 means the light is off, 1 is the minimum brightness and 100 is the maximum brightness supported by the light.
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 100
  brightness_step:
